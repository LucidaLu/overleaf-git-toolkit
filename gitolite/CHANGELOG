2023-07-14  v3.6.13 only one important fix:

                    remove the "description" file on new repos, to fix a bug
                    created by an optimisation made 6 years ago in 3.6.8 (and
                    was caught only in 2022 or so!)

2020-08-04  v3.6.12 mirroring terminology changes

                    install script can now modify #! lines when using a custom
                    perl executable

                    'config' user command allows for config values with spaces
                    in them

                    finally added notes in "t/README" on testing http mode and
                    mirroring, with pre-build helpers for Fedora and Manjaro

                    ...plus various bug fixes

2019-01-08  v3.6.11 fix security issue in 'rsync' (bundle helper); see commit
                    5df2b81 for more

2018-09-30  v3.6.10 fix up boo-boo caused by previous release; see mails on
                    list for details

2018-08-07  v3.6.9  prevent racy access to repos in process of migration to
                    gitolite

                    'info' learns new '-p' option to show only physical repos
                    (as opposed to wild repos)

2018-07-12  v3.6.8  fix bug when deleting *all* hooks for a repo

                    allow trailing slashes in repo names

                    make pre-receive hook driver bail on non-zero exit of a
                    pre-receive hook

                    allow templates in gitolite.conf (new feature)

                    various optimiations

2017-07-02  v3.6.7  allow repo-specific hooks to be organised into
                    subdirectories, and allow the multi-hook driver to be
                    placed in some other location of your choice

                    allow simple test code to be embedded within the
                    gitolite.conf file; see contrib/utils/testconf for how.
                    (This goes on the client side, not on the server)

                    allow syslog "facility" to be changed, from the default of
                    'local0'

                    allow @group names in config values to be expanded; it is
                    replaced with a space separated list of members

2016-09-08  v3.6.6  simple but important fix for a future perl deprecation
                    (perl will be removing "." from @INC in 5.24)

                    'perms' now requires a '-c' to activate batch mode
                    (should not affect interactive use but check your scripts
                    perhaps?)

                    gitolite setup now accepts a '-m' option to supply a
                    custom message (useful when it is used by a script)

2016-02-20  v3.6.5  allow creator check to be bypassed during mirroring

                    handle new style ssh fingerprinting correctly (thanks to
                    Robin Johnson)

                    allow pre-auto-gc as a repo-specific hook

                    optimise mirror pushes for heavily used repos

                    create-with-reference trigger: on repo creation, setup
                    objects/info/alternates for a server side alternate object
                    store.

                    'mirror status all all' prints a list of repos that have
                    *some* error, which is arguably more useful for further
                    action/processing

                    allow incrementally adding more repo-specific hooks

2015-11-01  v3.6.4  a ref-create bug in wild repos was fixed

                    some contrib code related to AD integration, and to
                    redmine user aliases

                    teach Alias.pm a few new tricks

                    remove a race condition in 'create' command that affected
                    the 'default roles' setting

                    make 'who-pushed' more efficient (local push logs, and
                    'tip search')

                    'gitolite query-rc' learns '-d' ('--dump') option

2015-04-26  v3.6.3  allow limited use of 'git config' using the new 'config'
                    command

                    accept openssh 6.8's new fingerprint output format

                    (finally!) allow limited symlinks within ~/repositories;
                    see commit 8e36230 for details

                    perms command now lists available roles

                    minor backward compat breakage: 'perms -l repo' no longer
                    works; see 'perms -h' for new usage

                    allow gitolite-shell to be used as $SHELL (experts only;
                    no support, no docs; see commit 9cd1e37 for details)

                    help with 'git push --signed' using a post-receive hook to
                    adopt push certs into 'refs/push-certs'; for details see
                    contrib/hooks/repo-specific/save-push-signatures

                    new 'transparent proxy' feature for git repos; see
                    src/lib/Gitolite/Triggers/TProxy.pm for details

2014-11-10  v3.6.2  disable ../ everywhere (see mailing list thread for
                    details)

                    VREF/NAME_NC -- like VREF/NAME but for new commits only.
                    Details within src/VREF/NAME_NC.

                    allow gitolite.conf to be tested locally; details within
                    contrib/utils/gitolite-local

2014-06-22  v3.6.1  experimental rc format convertor for "<= 3.3" users who
                    have already upgraded the *code* to ">= v3.4".  Program is
                    in contrib/utils.

                    giving shell access to a few users got a lot easier (see
                    comments in the rc file).

                    allow logging to syslog as well (see comments in the rc
                    file)

                    new 'motd' command

                    redis caching redone and now in core; see
                    http://gitolite.com/gitolite/cache.html

2014-05-09  v3.6    (cool stuff) the access command can now help you debug
                    your rules / understand how a specific access decision was
                    arrived at.

                    mirroring: since mirroring is asynchronous (by default
                    anyway), when a 'git push --mirror' fails, you may not
                    know it unless you look in the log file on the server.
                    Now gitolite captures the info and -- if the word 'fatal'
                    appears anywhere within it, it saves the entire output and
                    prints it to STDERR for anyone who reads or writes the
                    repo on the *master* server, until the error condition
                    clears up.

                    mirroring: allow 'nosync' slaves -- no attempt to
                    automatically push to these slaves will be made.  Instead,
                    you have to manually (or via cron, etc) trigger pushes.

                    (backward compat breakage) the old v2 syntax for
                    specifying gitweb owner and description is no longer
                    supported.

                    macros now allow strings as arguments (thanks to Jason
                    Donenfeld for the idea/problem).

                    the 'info' command can print in JSON format if asked to.

                    repo-specific hooks: now you can specify more than one,
                    and gitolite runs all of them in sequence.

                    new trigger 'expand-deny-messages' to show more details
                    when access is denied.

                    git-annex support is finally in master, yaaay!

                    new 'readme' command, modelled after 'desc'.  Apparently
                    gitweb can use a README.html file in the *bare* repo
                    directory -- who knew!

2013-10-14  v3.5.3  catch undefined groupnames (when possible)

                    mirroring: async push to slaves

                    (some portability fixes)

                    (a couple of contrib scripts - querying IPA based LDAP
                    servers for group membership, and user key management)

                    allow groups in subconf files (this *may* slow down
                    compilation in extreme cases)

                    make adding repo-specific hooks easier (see cust.mkd or
                    cust.html online for docs)

                    smart http now supports git 1.8.2 and above (which changed
                    the protocol requirements a wee bit)

2013-07-10  v3.5.2  allow ENV vars to be set from repo options, for use in
                    triggers and hooks

                    bug-fix: the new set-default-roles feature was being
                    invoked on every run of "perms" and overriding it!

2013-03-24  v3.5    (2 minor backward compat breakages)
                    1.  'DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMS' replaced by per repo
                        'default.roles' option
                    2.  'gitolite list-memberships' now requires a '-r' or a
                        '-u' flag

                    new 'gitolite owns' command (thanks to Kevin Pulo)

2013-03-05  v3.4    new rc file format makes it much easier to enable specific
                    features

2012-12-29  v3.3    bug fix: gl-perms propagation to slaves broke sometime
                    after v3.2 (so if you're only picking up tagged releases
                    you're OK)

                    the "D" command now allows rm/unlock to be totally
                    disabled

                    new trigger: update-gitweb-daemon-from-options; another
                    way to update gitweb and daemon access lists

                    new 'create' command for explicit wild repo creation, and
                    new AutoCreate trigger to control auto-creation

                    allow simple macros in conf file

2012-11-14  v3.2    major efficiency boost for large setups

                    optional support for multi-line pubkeys; see
                    src/triggers/post-compile/ssh-authkeys-split

                    bug fix for not creating gl-conf when repo para has only
                    config lines and no access rules

                    new 'bg' trigger command to put long jobs started from a
                    trigger into background

                    %GL_REPO and %GL_CREATOR now work for 'option's also

                    test suite now much more BSD friendly

2012-10-05  v3.1    (security) fix path traversal on wild repos

                    new %GL_CREATOR variable for git-config lines

                    rsync command to create and send bundles automagically

                    migrated 'who-pushed'

                    logical expressions on refexes!!!

2012-06-27  v3.04   documentation graduated and moved out of parents house :)

                    new trigger for 'repo specific umask'

                    new 'list-dangling-repos' command

                    new LOCAL_CODE rc var; allow admin specified programs to
                    override system-installed ones

                    new 'upstream' trigger-cum-command to maintain local
                    copies of external repos

                    new 'sudo' command

                    minor backward compat breakage in 'gitolite query-rc'

                    'perms' command can now create repo if needed

                    migrated 'symbolic-ref' command

                    'gitolite setup --hooks-only'

2012-05-23  v3.03   fix major bug that allowed an admin to get a shell

2012-05-20  v3.02   packaging instructions fixed up and smoke tested

                    make it easier to give some users a full shell

                    allow aliasing a repo to another name

                    simulate POST_CREATE for new normal (non-wild) repos

                    (just for kicks) a VREF that allows for voting on changes
                    to a branch

                    bug fix: smart http was not running PRE_ and POST_GIT
                    triggers

                    htpasswd migrated

2012-04-29  v3.01   mostly BSD and Solaris compat
                    also fork command added

2012-04-18  v3.0    first release to "master"
                    This is a compete rewrite of gitolite; please see
                    documentation before upgrading.
