# instructions for running the tests

# Pre-requisites

Install the following packages:

*   Manjaro (and probably Arch):

        pacman -S perl-json perl-json-xs apache

*   Fedora (and probably CentOS):

        dnf install -y perl-Test-Harness perl-JSON perl-JSON-XS httpd httpd-tools

*   others:

    (TBD)

# RUNNING THE MAIN TEST SUITE

    ======================================
    WARNING: THE TEST SUITE DELETES STUFF!
    ======================================

Please run the tests ONLY on a userid where it's ok to LOSE DATA.

On such a userid, clone gitolite then run this command in the clone:

    GITOLITE_TEST=y prove

http://gitolite.com/gitolite/testing.html has more details.  Alternatively,
https://gitolite.com/gitolite/install.html#trying-out-gitolite-safely will help you try out gitolite if
you want to play with gitolite safely.

# RUNNING THE HTTP AND MIRROR TESTS

    ======================================
    WARNING: THE TEST SUITE DELETES STUFF!
    ======================================

The http and mirror tests require a lot more preparation, including commands
and/or scripts to be run as root, so they're not invoked when you simply run
"prove" as above.

## Manjaro

1.  Create 3 users: sam, frodo, and gollum (`useradd -m`).

2.  Assuming you're running the tests using a local user called `g3`, run
    `visudo` and add the following line:

        g3 ALL = (sam,frodo,gollum) NOPASSWD: ALL

    Test this by running this command from within `g3` and making sure you get
    the correct results:

        sudo -u sam -i pwd
        # should print /home/sam
        # similarly make sure frodo and gollum also give correct results

    The mirror test will not run if this does not work.  That does not mean
    *mirroring* will not work; only the test suite depends on this feature.

3.  Manjaro does not, by default, add $HOME/bin to $PATH, so you will need the
    following on at least sam, frodo, and gollum:

        # copy-paste this into a root terminal
        for u in frodo sam gollum; do
            grep '$HOME/bin' /home/$u/.bash_profile || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> /home/$u/.bash_profile
        done

    Again, test this by running:

        sudo -u sam -i echo '$PATH'

    and making sure the output starts with `/home/sam/bin:` (and similarly for
    frodo and gollum).

4.  Take a look inside `t/manjaro-root-smart-http-test-setup` to make sure
    everything looks sane (because you have to run it as root!!), then run it
    as root.

5.  Now you are ready to run the last two tests:

        GITOLITE_TEST=y prove t/smart-http
        GITOLITE_TEST=y prove t/mirror-test

## Fedora

1.  Create 3 users: sam, frodo, and gollum (`useradd`).

2.  Assuming you're running the tests using a local user called `g3`, run
    `visudo` and add the following line:

        g3 ALL = (sam,frodo,gollum) NOPASSWD: ALL

    Test this by running this command from within `g3` and making sure you get
    the correct results:

        sudo -u sam -i pwd
        # should print /home/sam
        # similarly make sure frodo and gollum also give correct results

    The mirror test will not run if this does not work.  That does not mean
    *mirroring* will not work; only the test suite depends on this feature.

3.  Take a look inside `t/fedora-root-smart-http-test-setup` to make sure
    everything looks sane (because you have to run it as root!!), then run it
    as root.

4.  Now you are ready to run the last two tests:

        prove t/smart-http
        prove t/mirror-test
